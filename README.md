# landingpage
This project is a fully responsive landing page designed using only HTML and CSS. The main goal was to focus on layout design, mobile responsiveness, and clean Ul without using any JavaScript. This project helped improve my understanding of web structure, CSS styling, alignment, and responsive design principles.
